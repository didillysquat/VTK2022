# Advanced Technologies for the Life Sciences: Bioinformatics Practical
The markdown document will cover all aspects of the bioinformatics
practical related to the 2022 VTK Advanced Technologies for the Life Sciences.

# Introduction
In this practical we will process 2 RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets
to generate a selection of the analystical results presented in the two
papers associated with the datasets. One of the datasets is a bulk-RNA
dataset while the other is a single cell RNA (scRNA-seq) dataset.

[What is bulk RNA-seq](https://www.scdiscoveries.com/support/what-is-bulk-rna-sequencing/)

[What is single cell RNA-seq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-cell_transcriptomics)

## The papers
These are the two papers we will be working with:

- Bulk RNA-seq: [BÃ¶strom et al 2017](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0188772). Comparative cell cycle
transcriptomics reveals synchronization of developmental
transcription factor networks in cancer cells. PLOS ONE.

- scRNA-seq: [MacParland et al 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06318-7). Single cell RNA sequencing of human liver reveals distinct intrahepatic macrophage populations. Nature Communications.

Both papers have been uploaded to the ILLIAS system in Publications/SequAna

It would be a good idea to make yourself familiar with the papers before starting the practical work.

## Location
The practical will take place in room M739 from 09.00-16.30 on the 6-8th of December. It is currently unclear whether we will have access to the room on the 9th of Decemeber as well.

## Computing setup
You will need access to a computer to complete this practical.
While M739 does contain computers that you could use to login to the
SequAna computation server (where much of the work will occur)
this is a very inconvenient way to work as your home directory is
deleted after every session and it is not possible to install
applications that use Graphical User Interfaces (GUI).

As such it is strongly recommened that you bring a laptop with
you to complete the practical with. There will be 1 spare laptop
available for use during the practical session in M739, but this
laptop cannot leave the room as it belongs to SequAna.
